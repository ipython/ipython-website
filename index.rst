IPython: An Interactive Computing Environment
=============================================

The goal of IPython is to create a comprehensive environment for
interactive and exploratory computing.  To support, this goal, IPython
has two main components:

	- An enhanced interactive Python shell.
	- An architecture for interactive parallel computing.

All of IPython is open source (released under the revised BSD license), and it is
used by a range of `other projects <http://wiki.ipython.org/Projects_using_IPython>`_.
Have a look at the `talks and presentations <presentation.html>`_ we have given
about IPython.  

IPython supports Python 2.5 to 2.7 officially. If you need to use Python 2.4,
the 0.10 series probably works OK but has not been extensively tested with 2.4.

Citing IPython
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several of the authors of IPython are connected with academic and scientific
research, so it is important to us to be able to show the impact of our work in
other projects and fields.

If IPython contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication,
please acknowledge this fact by citing the project. You can use this
`ready-made citation entry <citing.html>`_.

Hosting
~~~~~~~
IPython has been generously hosted by `Enthought <http://enthought.com/>`_ almost since its inception.  We also use `GitHub <http://github.com/>`_ and `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ for code hosting and distributed version control.
