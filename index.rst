 IPython: Productive Interactive Computing
===========================================

IPython provides a rich toolkit to help you make the most out of using Python
interactively, with:

- Powerful Python shells (terminal- and Qt-based).
- A web-based notebook with the same core features but support for
  rich media, text, code, mathematical expressions and inline plots.
- Support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits.
- Flexible, embeddable interpreters to load into your own projects.
- High-performance and easy to use tools for (interactive) parallel computing.

IPython is open source (released under the revised BSD license), and is used by
a range of `other projects <http://wiki.ipython.org/Projects_using_IPython>`_.
We have :ref:`videos and screencasts <videos>`, you can download our `talks and
presentations <presentation.html>`_, or read our `extensive documentation
<documentation.html>`_.

IPython supports Python 2.6 to 2.7 and 3.1 or newer. Our older 0.10 series
supports Python 2.5, and can be used with Python 2.4.

Announcements
=============

- **IPython 0.12.1**: A bugfix-only release, that fixes over 70 issues, has
  been released on April 21, 2012.  All users of IPython 0.12 are encouraged to
  upgrade to this version.

- **IPython tutorial at PyCon 2012**: Fernando Perez, Brian Granger and Min
  Ragan-Kelley will present an `in-depth tutorial about IPython
  <https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/121/>`_.  Join us for a tour
  of IPython's architecture and hands-on examples on customization, embedding,
  effective uses of the various applications, the architecture of the web
  notebook and how to use IPython for parallel and distributed computing.

- **IPython 0.12**: We're pleased to announce the release of IPython 0.12, a
  major new version. The highlight of this release is the `IPython Notebook
  <ipython-doc/stable/interactive/htmlnotebook.html>`_, an interactive Python
  interface running in the browser. `Download <download.html>`_ it now, or read
  more about `what's new <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-0.12/whatsnew/version0.12.html>`_.
  
- **Try IPython online**: If you want to check out IPython before installing it,
  you can now `test drive it <http://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/>`_ in
  a web browser. Thanks to `PythonAnywhere <http://www.pythonanywhere.com/>`_
  for providing this.

Citing IPython
==============
Several of the authors of IPython are connected with academic and scientific
research, so it is important to us to be able to show the impact of our work in
other projects and fields.

If IPython contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication,
please acknowledge this fact by citing the project. You can use this
`ready-made citation entry <citing.html>`_.


Support
=======

We gratefully acknowledge the support we've received over the years:

- `Enthought Inc`_ has supported IPython since its beginning in multiple forms,
  including --but not limited to-- the funding of our Qt console, hosting our
  website for many years, the continued hosting of our mailing lists, and the
  inclusion of IPython in the `Enthought Python Distribution`_.

- NiPy_/NIH: funding via the NiPy project (NIH grant 5R01MH081909-02) supported
  our 2009 refactoring work.
  
- Sage_/NSF: funding via the grant `Sage: Unifying Mathematical Software for
  Scientists, Engineers, and Mathematicians
  <http://modular.math.washington.edu/grants/compmath09>`_ (NSF grant
  DMS-1015114) supported our Seattle 2011 developer meeting.

- Microsoft's team working on `Python Tools for Visual Studio
  <http://pytools.codeplex.com>`_ developed the integraton of IPython into the
  Python plugin for Visual Studio 2010.

- `Tech-X Corporation <http://txcorp.com>`__ supported in 2008 the development
  of our parallel computing tools.

- Google Summer of Code: in 2005 and 2010 we've had GSoC support for prototypes
  in several areas of the project.

- The Ohio Supercomputer Center and the Department of Defense High Performance
  Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP), for sponsoring work in 2009 on our
  parallel computing tools.
  
- `Bivio Software <http://www.bivio.biz>`_ hosted an IPython sprint in 2006, in
  addition to their support of the Front Range Pythoneers group in Boulder, CO.
  
- `GitHub <http://github.com/>`_ hosts our development workflow and
  documentation.

- `ShiningPanda <https://www.shiningpanda.com/>`_ gives us a free `continuous
  integration service <https://jenkins.shiningpanda.com/ipython/>`_.
