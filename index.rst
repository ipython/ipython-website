IPython provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with:

- Powerful interactive shells (terminal and `Qt-based`_).
- A browser-based notebook_ with support for code, text, mathematical
  expressions, inline plots and other rich media.
- Support for interactive data visualization and use of `GUI toolkits`_.
- Flexible, embeddable_ interpreters to load into your own projects.
- Easy to use, high performance tools for `parallel computing`_.

While the focus of the project is Python, our architecture is designed in a
language-agnostic way to facilitate interactive computing in any language.  An
interactive kernel speaks to clients such as the terminal or web notebook via a
well-specified protocol_, and all features of a kernel are available to all
clients.  We ship the official IPython kernel, but kernels for other languages
such as `Julia`_ and `Haskell`_ are actively developed and used.
Additionally, the IPython kernel supports multi-language
integration, letting you for example mix Python code with Cython_, R_, Octave_,
and scripting in `Bash, Perl or Ruby`_.

To get started with the IPython Notebook, see our `official example
collection`_.  Our `notebook gallery`__ is an excellent way to see the many
things you can do with IPython while learning about a variety of topics, from
basic programming to advanced statistics or quantum mechanics.

To learn more about IPython, you can watch our :ref:`videos and screencasts
<videos>`, download our `talks and presentations <presentation.html>`_, or read
our `extensive documentation <documentation.html>`_.  IPython is open source
(BSD license), and is used by a range of `other projects
<https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Projects-using-IPython>`_; add your project to that
list if it uses IPython as a library, and please don't forget to :ref:`cite the
project <citing>`.

IPython supports Python 2.7 and 3.3 or newer. Our older 1.x series supports
Python 2.6 and 3.2.


Jupyter and the future of IPython
=================================

IPython is a growing project, with increasingly language-agnostic components.
IPython 3.0 will be the last monolithic release of IPython,
containing the notebook server, qtconsole, etc. The language-agnostic parts of the project:
the notebook format, message protocol, qtconsole, notebook web application, etc.
will move to new projects under the name Jupyter_.
IPython itself will return to being focused on interactive Python,
part of which will be providing a Python kernel for Jupyter.
IPython 3.0 contains some indications of the project transition,
including the logo in the notebook web UI being that of Jupyter.

Announcements
=============

- **IPython 3.0**: We are proud to announce the availability of IPython 3.0,
  a major new release including lots of new stuff, including improved support
  for languages other than Python.
  `Install <install.html>`__ it now, or read about the changes in
  the `release notes
  <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/whatsnew/version3.html>`__.
- **Book**: Cyrille Rossant has published the `IPython Interactive Computing and Visualization Cookbook <books.html>`_, an advanced-level guide to IPython for data science, and the sequel of his previous book on IPython. We thank Packt Publishing for donating a portion of the proceeds from this book to support IPython's development.

- **IPython 2.4**: A bugfix and minor feature release for IPython 2.x, released
  30th January 2015.

Citing IPython
==============

Several of the authors of IPython are connected with academic and scientific
research, so it is important for us to be able to show the impact of our work
in other projects and fields.

If IPython contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication,
please acknowledge this fact by citing the project. You can use this
`ready-made citation entry <citing.html>`_.
