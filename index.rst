HyperSpy: multi-dimensional data analysis toolbox
================================================

HyperSpy is an open source Python library which provides tools to facilitate
the interactive data analysis of multi-dimensional datasets that can be
described as multi-dimensional arrays of a given signal (e.g. a 2D array of
spectra a.k.a spectrum image).

HyperSpy aims at making it easy and natural to apply analytical procedures that
operate on an individual signal to multi-dimensional arrays, as well as
providing easy access to analytical tools that exploit the multi-dimensionality
of the dataset.

Its modular structure makes it easy to add features to analyze different kinds
of signals.

Highlights
==========


* Two families of named and scaled axes: *signal* and *navigation*.
* Visualization tools for multi-dimensional spectra and images.
* Easy access multi-dimensional curve fitting and blind source separation.
* Built on top of NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and scikit-learn.
* Modular design for easy extensibility.

The development has been motivated by the data analysis needs of the
electron microscopy community but it is proving useful in many other fields.
