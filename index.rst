IPython provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with:

- A powerful interactive shell.
- A kernel for Jupyter_.
- Support for interactive data visualization and use of `GUI toolkits`_.
- Flexible, embeddable_ interpreters to load into your own projects.
- Easy to use, high performance tools for `parallel computing`_.

To get started with IPython in the Jupyter Notebook, see our `official example
collection`_.  Our `notebook gallery`__ is an excellent way to see the many
things you can do with IPython while learning about a variety of topics, from
basic programming to advanced statistics or quantum mechanics.

To learn more about IPython, you can download our :doc:`talks and presentations
<presentation>`, or read
our `extensive documentation <documentation.html>`_.  IPython is open source
(BSD license), and is used by a range of `other projects
<https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Projects-using-IPython>`_; add your project to that
list if it uses IPython as a library, and please don't forget to :ref:`cite the
project <citing>`.

IPython supports Python 2.7 and 3.3 or newer. Our older 1.x series supports
Python 2.6 and 3.2.


Jupyter and the future of IPython
=================================

IPython is a growing project, with increasingly language-agnostic components.
IPython 3.x was the last monolithic release of IPython,
containing the notebook server, qtconsole, etc.
As of IPython 4.0, the language-agnostic parts of the project:
the notebook format, message protocol, qtconsole, notebook web application, etc.
have moved to new projects under the name Jupyter_.
IPython itself is focused on interactive Python,
part of which is providing a Python kernel for Jupyter.

Citing IPython
==============

Several of the authors of IPython are connected with academic and scientific
research, so it is important for us to be able to show the impact of our work
in other projects and fields.

If IPython contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication,
please acknowledge this fact by citing the project. You can use this
`ready-made citation entry <citing.html>`_.
