  given at various venues regarding IPython over the years.
* `Videos and screencasts <videos.html>`_.
* IPython `screenshots <screenshots/index.html>`_.
* An `article about IPython
  <http://fperez.org/papers/ipython07_pe-gr_cise.pdf>`_, written by Fernando
  Perez and Brian Granger, published in the `May/June 2007 issue

  the journal *Computing in Science and Engineering*.

External documentation, related presentations and tutorials
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of presentations, often by authors outside of the core
IPython team. Some are focused on aspects of IPython itself while others may be
about external projects that use IPython as a key component. If you have any
material that fits this description, please contact the IPython team and let us
know about it so we can post it here.

* The `BCPy2000 project <http://bci2000.org/downloads/BCPy2000/About.html>`_
  offers Python tools for Brain-Computer interface development, and it uses
  IPython in a really neat way to enable interactive debugging of all the
  components as they operate in real-time. `This talk
  <http://videolectures.net/mloss08_hill_bcpy/>`_ presented at the 2008 NIPS
  conference shows the system.
* `Jose Unpingco <http://www.osc.edu/~unpingco>`_ made this really neat
  `screencast <http://www.osc.edu/~unpingco/Tutorial_11Dec.html>`_ showing how
  to couple IPython's parallel capabilities with the `Vision
  <http://mgltools.scripps.edu>`_ environment. Vision is an extremely
  impressive visual programming environment developed by `Michel Sanner's
  <http://www.scripps.edu/~sanner>`_ team at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla,
  CA.
* An `article
  <http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2008/02/07/python-for-bash-scripters-a-well-kept-secret>`__
  by Noah Gift on RedHat Magazine that covers using Python, and IPython, as a
  better Bash.
* An `article
  <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-netsnmpnipython>`__ by Noah
  Gift at the IBM Developer Works site, on using the Net-SNMP library to
  interactively explore and manage a network (the interactive part courtesy of
  IPython, of course).
* A `post and video
  <http://blog.boucault.net/post/2007/12/10/IPython-and-Pigment-simplicity>`_
  about using IPython's GTK support to interactively control a `Pigment
  <https://code.fluendo.com/pigment/trac>`_ application. It also uses the
  IPython demo class.
* A `set of slides <http://www.python-industries.com/clepy/ipython/>`_
  introducing IPython and summarizing its features. A good introduction for the
  newcomer, and even experienced users may find things there they didn't know
  about.
* An `article <http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/47635>`__ at Linux.com about
  IPython, by Conrad Koziol.
* An `article <http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2005/01/27/ipython.html>`__ by
  Jeremy Jones at ONLamp.com, introducing IPython to new users and giving a
  tour of its features as a replacement for the default Python shell.
* The O'Reilly book `"Python for Unix and Linux System Administration"
  <http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515829/>`_ has a chapter (the first, and
  largest one) on IPython. IPython is also used throughout the book to
  illustrate other Python technologies.

Other projects using IPython
----------------------------

`Here <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Projects-using-IPython>`_ you can
find a list of projects that use IPython in one form or another. If you use
IPython as part of a project, please do add your information to this page or
email `Fernando.Perez@Berkeley.edu <mailto:Fernando.Perez@Berkeley.edu>`_ and
I'll be happy to add it.  Also, if your project is of academic relevance,
please `provide a citation to IPython <citing.html>`_.
