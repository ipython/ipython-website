 Citing IPython
================

If IPython been significant to a project that leads to an academic publication,
please acknowledge that fact by citing the project.  As of now, the canonical
academic reference for IPython is `this paper
<http://fperez.org/papers/ipython07_pe-gr_cise.pdf>`_, for which here are both
a BibTex and a plaintext reference you can use::

  @Article{PER-GRA:2007,
    Author         = {P\'erez, Fernando and Granger, Brian E.},
    Title          = {{IP}ython: a {S}ystem for {I}nteractive {S}cientific
                   {C}omputing},
    Journal        = {{C}omput. {S}ci. {E}ng.},
    Volume         = {9},
    Number         = {3},
    Pages          = {21-29},
    month          = may,
    year           = 2007,
    url            = "http://ipython.org",
  }

or in plaintext:
