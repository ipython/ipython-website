Installing IPython
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are multiple ways of installing IPython, and our official documentation
contains `detailed instructions
<http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/install/install.html>`_ for manual
installs from source, targeted at advanced users and developers.

For new users who want to get up and running with minimal effort, we suggest
you follow the instructions on this page, which provide a setup based on Python
2.7.  This includes all the dependencies to run the notebook and optionally the
basic libraries for scientific computing and data analysis.

.. note::

   We have just made a new release, and it will take some time to appear in
   Anaconda, Enthought Canopy and Linux distributions.

**Mac or Windows**

1. Download and install `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads.html>`_ or the
free edition of `Enthought Canopy
<https://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php>`_.

2. Update IPython to the current version:

* On a Mac, using the Terminal application:

  Anaconda::

    conda update conda
    conda update ipython

  Enthought Canopy::

    sudo enpkg enstaller
    sudo enpkg ipython

* On Windows, at the Command Prompt (``cmd.exe`` application):

  Anaconda::

    conda update conda
    conda update ipython

  Enthought Canopy::

    enpkg enstaller
    enpkg ipython

**Linux**

On Linux, most distributions have everything you need in their package
managers.

1. Install IPython and its dependencies:

* On Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions, type at the shell::

    sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook

* On Fedora 18 and newer related distributions, use::

    sudo yum install python-ipython-notebook

2. Optionally install additional tools for scientific computing:

* On Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions, type at the shell::

    sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-scipy \
                         python-pandas python-sympy python-nose

* On Fedora 18 and newer related distributions, use::

    sudo yum install python-matplotlib scipy python-pandas sympy python-nose

Downloads
---------

You can manually download IPython from either `Github
<http://github.com/ipython/ipython/releases>`_ or `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipython>`_.  Those locations contain source
distributions as well as binary Windows installers, which will be recognized by
``easy_install`` and ``pip`` (for the source ones).

Our `downloads archive <http://archive.ipython.org/release>`_ also contains all
IPython releases, including old versions.
