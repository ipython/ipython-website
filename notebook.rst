 The IPython Notebook
======================

The IPython Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment where
you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a
single document:

These notebooks are normal files that can be shared with colleagues, converted
to other formats such as HTML or PDF, etc.  You can share any publicly
available notebook by using the `IPython Notebook Viewer
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org>`_ service which will render it as a static web
page. This makes it easy to give your colleagues a document they can read
immediately without having to install anything.

To learn more about using the IPython Notebook, you can visit our `example
collection`_, and you can read the documentation_ for all the details on how to
use and configure the system. The `Notebook Gallery`_ showcases many
interesting notebooks covering a variety of topics, from basic programming to
advanced scientific computing.


Here is a short demo of the notebook's basic features by the Pybonacci_ team:
