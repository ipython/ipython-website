========================================

We are thrilled to announce that in August 2013, Microsoft made a donation of
$100,000 to sponsor IPython's continued development.

This donation was received through NumFOCUS_, and is the next step in a
fruitful collaboration IPython has had with Microsoft:

- In 2009 we added integration with Windows HPC Server for IPython's parallel
  computing capabilities.

- In 2010, the `Python Tools for Visual Studio`_ team developed integration
  with IPython into the PTVS project.

- In 2012, we showed how IPython could be integrated into an `Azure-based
  workflow`_, using the Notebook to easily control computational resources
  in Microsoft's cloud platform.

We are extremely grateful for this contribution, which we will use to continue
strengthening multiple aspects of IPython.  While we have other sources of
funding and the support of the larger open source community, these new funds
will help us to focus effort in specific areas where we identify additional
challenges or opportunities beyond the scope of those resources.
