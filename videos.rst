Science And Python: retrospective of a (mostly) successful decade
=================================================================

A historical view of the co-evolution of IPython and the scientific Python
stack (1h), that has been very well received. Delivered by `Fernando Perez`_ as
a keynote presentation at the PyCon Canada 2012 conference in Toronto, it
contains multiple demos of the workflows that IPython enables (`PDF slides

IPython: Python at your fingertips
==================================

An overview of IPython (40 min) (`PDF slides
<http://fperez.org/talks/1203_ipython_pycon.pdf>`_), delivered by `Fernando
Perez`_ at the PyCon 2012 conference in Santa Clara, CA.  It combines a rapid
overview of the IPython project with hands-on demos using the new HTML notebook
interface.

More videos and screencasts
===========================

* Kurt Schwehr has an `excellent set of videos up on YouTube
  <http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7E11B34616530F5E&feature=plcp>`__
  that describe the use of Python as a research tool.  These were made as part
  of a `course at the University of New Hampshire
  <http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/~schwehr/Classes/2011/esci895-res­earchtools>`__.
  The topics covered go beyond IPython, and it's a very cohesive set of
  lectures around the kinds of workflows that IPython was built for.

* Brian Granger has a number of screencasts on his `YouTube channel
  <http://www.youtube.com/user/ellisonbg>`_ about using IPython's parallel
  computing capabilities.  These include a number of examples and a guide to
  getting started with IPython and Windows HPC Server 2008. Two of `these

  are also being hosted on Microsoft's channel 9.
* The `ShowMeDo <http://showmedo.com>`_ site contains instructional videos on a
  number of topics.  `This page <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/ShowMeDo>`_
  (from our own wiki) contains further information on ideas for new
  IPython-related videos.
* Jose Unpingco has created a set of screencasts on using the Vision/IPython
  combo for parallel computing. They are available both at the `Ohio
  Supercomputer Center's user site <https://www.osc.edu/cms/sip/node/17>`_ and
  at `ShowMeDo <http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=XCsI4bsup>`__.
* Another `series at ShowMeDo by Jose Unpingco
  <http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=N49qyIFOh>`__ makes up a
  tutorial on IPython with a focus on scientific computing, which also include
  a lot of useful tips on Windows setup and configuration.
* A new `5-part series <http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=CnluURUTV>`_ by
  Jeff Rush, approximately 1 hour long. Jeff uses a working IPython to show
  many features. Created 2007.
* A new `5-minute slideshow overview
  <http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=980000&amp;fromSeriesID=98>`_ by Jeff
  Rush entitled "Python and the Interactive Shell 'IPython'". Created 2007.
* A set `of 4 videos
  <http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=PythonIPythonSeries>`_ by Ian Ozsvald
  showing various aspects of IPython. Created 2006.
