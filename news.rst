Sloan Foundation Grant
----------------------

IPython has been awarded a $1.15 million grant from `the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation <http://www.sloan.org/>`_. This will support several core developers,
who'll focus on building the IPython Notebook into a tool for open, collaborative,
reproducible scientific computing. We'll also be bringing developers together
for two sprints each year in California. `See more details. <sloan-grant.html>`_

IPython 0.13
------------
IPython 0.13 was released on June 30, 2012. This release sees a substantial
redesign of the IPython Notebook, the introduction of 'cell magic functions',
as well as numerous other improvements. `Download <download.html>`__ it now, or
see the `release notes
<http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-0.13/whatsnew/version0.13.html>`__ for more
details.

IPython 0.12.1
--------------

IPython 0.12.1 was released on April 21, 2012.  This is a bugfix-only release;
no new features have been introduced but `over 70 issues`_ have been fixed.
All users of IPython 0.12 are encouraged to upgrade to this release.

.. _over 70 issues: http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/whatsnew/github-stats-0.12.html#issues-list-012


IPython 0.12
------------

IPython 0.12 was released on 18 December 2011. The major new feature with this

Try IPython online
------------------

As of Autumn 2011, you can `try IPython online
<http://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/>`__ in your browser. New users can
explore the features before installing it, or you can do some quick
calculations from any computer with web access.

Thanks to the guys at `PythonAnywhere <http://www.pythonanywhere.com/>`__ for
providing this. If you sign up for an account there (it's in beta at the moment),
you also get persistent consoles, disk space, and more.

IPython 0.11
------------

We're pleased to announce the immediate release of IPython 0.11, on 31 July 2011.
Despite the small shift in the version number, this brings a lot of changes,
including a new Qt frontend and a rewritten parallel computing framework.
`Download <download.html>`__ it now, or look at `what's new
<http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-0.11/whatsnew/version0.11.html>`__.

User survey
-----------

From May to September 2011, we ran a survey to find out more about who uses
IPython, amassing 240 responses by the time we closed it. We'd like to thank all
the respondents, and invite you to `read the findings <usersurvey2011.html>`__.

IPython 0.10.2 released
-----------------------

IPython 0.10.2 was released on 9 April, 2011. This is a bugfix release for the
0.10 series. See the `release notes
<http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-0.10.2/html/changes.html#release-0-10-2>`__
for more details.

Python 3 support in progress
----------------------------

Work has started to get IPython running on Python 3. If you're interested in
testing it, get `the code <https://github.com/ipython/ipython-py3k>`__ from
GitHub. We hope to release this along with IPython 0.11.

IPython 0.10.1 is out!
----------------------

On October 11, 2010, we released IPython 0.10.1. The full release notes can be
found `here
<http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-0.10.1/html/changes.html#release-0-10-1>`__
,
describing in detail the changes in this release.

Windows HPC Server Case Study
-----------------------------

As a result of the Microsoft-funded work on providing support for Windows HPC
Server 2008, a `case study
<http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Case_Study_Detail.aspx?CaseStudyID=4000007661
case study>`__ is now available that provides some details on the collaboration
between IPython and the University of Colorado's Mechanical Engineering
Department.

Support for Windows HPC Server 2008
-----------------------------------

.. image:: logos/logo-hpc2008-header.png


Recently, we have added support for Windows HPC Server 2008 in ipcluster.  This
makes it easy to get started with IPython's parallel computing capabilities on
Windows. These features are now in trunk and will be in the upcoming 0.11
release.  Brian Granger has created a `whitepaper
<attachment:ipython_winhpc_whitepaper_v1.pdf>`__ and `two

about using IPython on Windows HPC Server 2008. Additional information about
these features can be found in our documentation `here
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/nightly/html/parallel/parallel_winhpc.html>`__.
Many thanks to Microsoft for funding this effort.

What will become IPython 0.11 is taking shape, big changes ahead
----------------------------------------------------------------

As of November 2009, we have major changes coming to IPython. The next release
will include a lot of architectural updates, all of which we know are necessary
to really make significant improvements to IPython, but that also include
inevitable backward compatibility breaks.  We would like to encourage you to
start looking at the `nightly documentation
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/nightly/html/whatsnew/development.html>`__ and
`source tarball
<http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/testing/ipython-dev-nightly.tgz>`__ (you can also
follow the trunk from `Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/ipython/trunk>`__).

IPython 0.10 has been released
------------------------------

On August 4 2009, we've released version 0.10 of IPython.  The full release
notes can be found `here
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/rel-0.10/html/changes.html#release-0-10>`__,
describing in detail all new features, bug fixes and API changes of this
release.

IPython 0.9.1 has been released
-------------------------------

Unfortunately, release 0.9 turned out to have compatibility issues with Python
2.4.  This quick bugfix release addresses this issue but adds no other
features.

IPython 0.9 is out!
-------------------

On September 14, 2008, the IPython team is proud to release version 0.9 final.
See `here <http://ipython.scipy.org/announcements/ann-ipython-0.9.txt>`__ for
the full announcement; a detailed description of the changes can be found `here
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/rel-0.9/html/changes.html#release-0-9>`__.

IPython 0.9 betas are ready
---------------------------

At `the usual location <http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/testing>`__ you can now
find the beta release of the 0.9 upcoming release.  We'd greatly appreciate
your testing and feedback!

IPython1 is dead, long live IPython (Summer 2008)
-------------------------------------------------

For the past three years, IPython1 has existed as a separate codebase from
IPython.  IPython1 was being used to develop IPython's architecture for
parallel computing as well as test new ideas for IPython itself.  Because the
parallel computing stuff is relatively stable now, we have completely merged
IPython1 into IPython.  Thus starting with IPython version 0.9, the parallel
computing capabilities (as well as a lot more new stuff) of IPython1 will be
available in regular IPython.  From here on out, there is no IPython1, just
IPython.

IPython 0.8.4
-------------
IPython 0.8.4 was released.

IPython 0.8.3
-------------
IPython 0.8.3 was released. See `what's new <whatsnew083.html>`__.

IPython1 and the Scripps Institute's Vision
------------------------------------------- 

`Jose Unpingco <http://www.osc.edu/~unpingco>`__ made this really neat
`screencast <http://www.osc.edu/~unpingco/Tutorial_11Dec.html>`__ showing how to
couple IPython1 with the `Vision <http://mgltools.scripps.edu>`__ environment.
Vision is an extremely impressive visual programming environment developed by
`Michel Sanner's <http://www.scripps.edu/~sanner>`__ team at the Scripps
Institute in La Jolla, CA.

Peter Sheats describing how to use IPython as the interactive shell for Django.

A new article about IPython at IBM Developer Works (Dec 12, 2007)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Noah Gift wrote a great `article

First release of IpyKit (May 24, 2007)
--------------------------------------

`IpyKit <http://wiki.python.org/moin/IPyKit>`__ is a standalone IPython executable,
created with py2exe and as such works on machines without python (or where you
just don't have time to mess with installation). It includes pyreadline for
full tab completion and color support. Get the first release (fully functional,
based on svn IPython) `here
<http://vivainio.googlepages.com/ipykit.zip>`__. Just unzip and run ipython.exe
to go.

Backports for 0.8.1 (may 23, 2007)
----------------------------------

We will backport some critical bug fixes to 0.8.1, if necessary - even if we
may not cut an official release, you can trust that the quality of the latest
version in 0.8.1 branch is at least as good as the 0.8.1 release. Get it with
svn by doing `svn co
<http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/branches/0.8.1>`__. See the
`changelog
<http://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/branches/0.8.1/doc/ChangeLog>`__
for the list of applied fixes.

IPython 0.8.1 is released (May 10, 2007)
