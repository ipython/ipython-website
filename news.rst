Many thanks to Microsoft for funding this effort.

What will become IPython 0.11 is taking shape, big changes ahead
----------------------------------------------------------------

As of November 2009, we have major changes coming to IPython. The next release
will include a lot of architectural updates, all of which we know are necessary
to really make significant improvements to IPython, but that also include
inevitable backward compatibility breaks.  We would like to encourage you to
start looking at the `nightly documentation
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/nightly/html/whatsnew/development.html>`__ and
`source tarball
<http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/testing/ipython-dev-nightly.tgz>`__ (you can also
follow the trunk from `Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/ipython/trunk>`__).

IPython 0.10 has been released
------------------------------

On August 4 2009, we've released version 0.10 of IPython.  The full release
notes can be found `here
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/rel-0.10/html/changes.html#release-0-10>`__,
describing in detail all new features, bug fixes and API changes of this
release.

IPython 0.9.1 has been released
-------------------------------

Unfortunately, release 0.9 turned out to have compatibility issues with Python
2.4.  This quick bugfix release addresses this issue but adds no other
features.

IPython 0.9 is out!
-------------------

On September 14, 2008, the IPython team is proud to release version 0.9 final.
See `here <http://ipython.scipy.org/announcements/ann-ipython-0.9.txt>`__ for
the full announcement; a detailed description of the changes can be found `here
<http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/rel-0.9/html/changes.html#release-0-9>`__.

IPython 0.9 betas are ready
---------------------------

At `the usual location <http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/testing>`__ you can now
find the beta release of the 0.9 upcoming release.  We'd greatly appreciate
your testing and feedback!

IPython1 is dead, long live IPython (Summer 2008)
-------------------------------------------------

For the past three years, IPython1 has existed as a separate codebase from
IPython.  IPython1 was being used to develop IPython's architecture for
parallel computing as well as test new ideas for IPython itself.  Because the
parallel computing stuff is relatively stable now, we have completely merged
IPython1 into IPython.  Thus starting with IPython version 0.9, the parallel
computing capabilities (as well as a lot more new stuff) of IPython1 will be
available in regular IPython.  From here on out, there is no IPython1, just
IPython.

IPython 0.8.4
-------------
IPython 0.8.4 was released.

IPython 0.8.3
-------------
IPython 0.8.3 was released. See `what's new <whatsnew083.html>`__.

IPython1 and the Scripps Institute's Vision
------------------------------------------- 

`Jose Unpingco <http://www.osc.edu/~unpingco>`__ made this really neat
`screencast <http://www.osc.edu/~unpingco/Tutorial_11Dec.html>`__ showing how to
couple IPython1 with the `Vision <http://mgltools.scripps.edu>`__ environment.
