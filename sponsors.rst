As of Summer 2013, `Rackspace <http://www.rackspace.com>`_ generously provides
cloud hosting for the project. This is used for development and the hosting of
IPython related services, such as the `IPython Notebook Viewer
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org>`_. We thank Jesse Noller and Kyle Kelley at
Rackspace for setting up this sponsorship and helping with deployment
respectively.
