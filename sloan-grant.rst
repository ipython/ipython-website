======================
Sloan Foundation Grant
======================

We are pleased to announce that the IPython project has received a $1.15M grant
from `the Alfred P. Sloan foundation <http://sloan.org>`_, that will support
IPython development for the next two years (1/1/2013-12/31/2014). The grant,
which is being made to the University of California, Berkeley and California
Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, will enable the project to focus
on developing the IPython Notebook as a general tool for scientific and
technical computing that is open, collaborative and reproducible.

The grant ( `html`_ | `pdf`_ ) will fund the following project staff for two
years:

* Fernando Perez, UC Berkeley, ¾ time project PI
* Brian Granger, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, ¾ time project co-PI
* Min Ragan-Kelley, UC Berkeley, full time lead project engineer
* Paul Ivanov, UC Berkeley, Postdoc, full time developer
* Thomas Kluyver, UC Berkeley, Postdoc, full time developer
* Matthew Brett, UC Berkeley, ½ time researcher (Y1), applied statistics Notebooks
* JB Poline, UC Berkeley, ½ time researcher (Y1), applied statistics Notebooks

The main objectives of the grant are:

* Build interactive JavaScript widgets for the IPython Notebook that enable
  computations and visualizations to be controlled with UI controls (sliders,
  buttons, etc.).
* Improve the IPython Notebook format by creating libraries for converting
  Notebooks to various formats (LaTeX, PDF, HTML, Presentations) and integrating
  these into the Notebook web application.
* Adding multiuser support to the Notebook web application, to enable small to
  medium sized groups of trusted individuals to run a central Notebook server
  for collaborative research and teaching.
* Develop IPython Notebooks for applied statistics in collaboration with
  Jonathan Taylor, who will use these materials in his Applied Statistics
  course at Stanford (`STAT 191 <http://www.stanford.edu/class/stats191>`_)

The grant will also provide resources for two development sprints per year at
UC Berkeley, which will include all of the core IPython developers, as well as
funding for cloud computing resources (for things like CI hosting and nbviewer)
and conference travel for project staff.

We'd like to thank Josh Greenberg, our program director at the Sloan foundation,
for the phenomenal guidance and support he provided during the grant proposal
preparation and detailed review process. We look forward to working with him
over the next few years!

And last but not least, we want to thank the entire community of users and
developers of IPython, without whom this would not have been possible: IPython
is a project driven strictly by the real-world needs of its users, and therein
lies its value.
