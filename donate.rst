 Support IPython Development
=============================

IPython will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and
released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.  But while the
whole team does its best to work efficiently, and we actively try to find
funding from multiple sources, the reality is that we have limited resources
and this fact hinders our development capabilities.

If you have found IPython to be useful in your work, research or company,
please consider making a donation to the project commensurate with your
resources.  Any amount helps!

All donations will be used strictly to fund IPython development, by supporting
tasks such as developer sprints, better installers, improved documentation and
paying for hosting costs for services such as the `IPython Notebook Viewer
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org>`_.

Our donations are managed by the NumFOCUS_ foundation, which passes 100% of your
contribution to the IPython project. NumFOCUS is a 501(c)3 non-profit
