Roadmap to 1.0 and Beyond
-------------------------

TL;DR summary: Hi! IPython 1.0 coming mid-July 2013. See the grant_ which is
funding the bulk of the work, as well as our roadmap_ for achieving the
grant's objectives.

There's been a lot of excitement on about the grant the IPython team received
from the Sloan Foundation. The easiest way to communicate the contents of the
Sloan grant is to just provide it in its entirety, which is what we've done
with direct links for `html`_ and  `pdf`_ version.

The interested reader will find a description of changes coming to IPython
over the next two years, as well as the motivation behind them, and the
personnel involved. (For example, the astute reader of the grant will
correctly infer that this email is one way in which I am filling my
responsibility as "community engagement and evangelism"... GO TEAM!)

Two weeks ago, the bulk of IPython's core contributors had a series of
planning sessions.  For three days,  `Brian`_,  `Fernando`_,  `Min`_, and
`I`_ met on campus in Berkeley, with  `Thomas`_ and  `Matthias`_
joining in via video teleconference (and `Brad`_, for one of the days, too).

You can see the  `full notes from those meetings`_.

Our primary objective was to outline a plan of what work we want to accomplish
in the next two years (broadly speaking) as well as to make concrete goals for
our next (1.0!) release, which will land around Bastille Day (July 14th, 2013,
for the uninitiated).

It's kind of funny that there's a message from Fernando to [ipython-user] back
in April of 2005 titled  `"Towards IPython 1.0, the famous big cleanup"`_. In
it, Fernando makes a last call for outstanding critical bugs because he's
preparing users for a transition toward big changes in the IPython code base.
Because, once he makes the first commit and starts working on the cleanup,
he'll have to ignore every request made "until the new shiny ipython emerges
from the process, reborn in a glory which shall blind the world." Toward the
end of the email, he finishes with: "I hope the changes will be worth it, and
when the dust settles, we'll have something we can call IPython 1.0"... And
eight years and a few months after that email was sent, we will! :)

What will 1.0 look like? Biggest changes on the user side will be the
integration of  `nbconvert`_ into IPython proper. But that's just my summary
of it, the interested reader is encouraged to read the gory details in the
roadmap_.


that's it from me for now,

best,

Paul Ivanov
